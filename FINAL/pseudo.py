#variables: health damage luck 
#variable for secret room, changes if room is entered so room cant be entered again
#dictionary for "inventory"

#function for each room, change boolean if entered to make sure interactions cant happen twice

#example function for room:
#welcoming to room
#print description of room
#if monster first thing is fight or run
#if no monster describe any chests or suspicious walls
#suspicious wall for secret room
#to salve the problem of being able to pick up items multiple times, ill make an if statement checking if item is in dictionary if not then it will present item or if yes then it wont, for moinsters, ill either make them drop an item that can be checked, or have a variable that can be changed
